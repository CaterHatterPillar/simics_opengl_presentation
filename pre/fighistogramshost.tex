	\caption[Benchmark results - hardware accelerated on the simulation host]{Histogram depicting benchmark elapsed frametimes in milliseconds and the density distribution of 1000 frames whilst hardware accelerated on the simulation host. The $Y$ axis thus depict sample density. Its axis keys have been removed as they bear no relevance to the outcomes presented in this document.}
