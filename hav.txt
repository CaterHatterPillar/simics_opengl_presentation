Julia:
Iterations Paravirtualization Software rasterization
225 55 51913
450 66 98205
900 104 180536

Observation:
For paravirtualization, Julia performs roughly at a tenth of a second (don't mention: and below).
For software rasterization, Julia performs in the span of 52, 98, and 180 seconds, or at roughly a minute (don't mention: and above). This is up to three orders of magnitude slower.

Chess
Tiles Paravirtualization Software rasterization
60x60 972 7302
84x84 1691 10362
118x118 3365 13351

Observation:
For paravirtualization, Chess performs at 1, 1.7, and 3.4 seconds, or roughly a second (don't mention: and above).
For software rasterization, Chess performs at 7.3, 10.4, and 13.4 seconds, or roughly an order of magnitude slower than paravirtualization.
