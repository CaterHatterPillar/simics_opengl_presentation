\begin{itemize}
\item Virtual platforms are key to reducing Time-to-Market
\item Improved simulation performance enables more use-cases
\item Because of architectural differences, GPU workloads are sub-optimal for CPUs
\item Therefore, some method of accelerating graphics in Simics is desireable
\end{itemize}
