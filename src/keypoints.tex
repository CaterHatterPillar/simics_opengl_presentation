\begin{block}{\#1}
	Paravirtualization is feasible for accelerating graphics in virtual platforms.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{\#2}
	Magic instructions is promising methodology to carry real-time invocations between target and host systems.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{\#3}
	Likely that paravirtualized graphics may be subject to deterministic execution, checkpointing, and reverse execution.
