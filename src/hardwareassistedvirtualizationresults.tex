\begin{itemize}
	\item Without hardware-assisted virtualization, hit to software rasterization is roughly two orders of magnitude compared to hardware acceleration
	\item Hit to paravirtualization is often less than an order of magnitude
	\item Paravirtualization renders up to three orders of magnitude faster than software rasterization
        \item This entails that the Chess benchmark is accelerated by paravirtualization
        \item We conclude that effects of paravirtualization increase by one order of magnitude if hardware-assisted virtualization is not available
        \item Workloads that are otherwise sub-optimal are thus accelerated
\end{itemize}
