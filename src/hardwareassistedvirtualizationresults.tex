%% \begin{itemize}
%% 	\item Without hardware-assisted virtualization, hit to software rasterization is roughly two orders of magnitude compared to hardware acceleration
%% 	\item Hit to paravirtualization is often less than an order of magnitude
%% 	\item Paravirtualization renders up to three orders of magnitude faster than software rasterization
%%         \item This entails that the Chess benchmark is accelerated by paravirtualization
%%         \item We conclude that effects of paravirtualization increase by one order of magnitude if hardware-assisted virtualization is not available
%%         \item Workloads that are otherwise sub-optimal are thus accelerated
