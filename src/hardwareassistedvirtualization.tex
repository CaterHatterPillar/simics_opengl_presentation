\begin{itemize}
	\item Simics relies on interpretation and JIT to accelerate simulation
	\item To further speed-up simulation, Simics can utilize hardware-assisted virtualization on those processors that support it
	\item This requires that the simulated platform corresponds to the host platform
\end{itemize}
