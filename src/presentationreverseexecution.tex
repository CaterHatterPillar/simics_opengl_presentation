\frametitle{Reverse execution}

\begin{block}{Currently}
	Graphics displayed exclusively in the host system
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Assumption}
	A potential productification of paravirtualized graphics would feature graphics output in the target system
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Prediction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If so, framebuffers would be present in target memory
		\item It follows that reverse execution functionality in Simics tracks said memory in checkpoints; effectively accomodating for reverse execution graphics
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
